# Namespace Definition for XD Application
# ======================================
# This file defines a Kubernetes namespace called "xd" which provides
# logical isolation and organization for our application resources.
#
# WHY NAMESPACES ARE NECESSARY IN KUBERNETES:
# ===========================================
# 1. RESOURCE ISOLATION: Namespaces provide logical boundaries that separate
#    resources, preventing naming conflicts between different applications
#    or environments (dev, staging, prod).
#
# 2. ACCESS CONTROL: Enable fine-grained RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
#    by allowing different teams to have different permissions for different
#    namespaces.
#
# 3. RESOURCE QUOTAS: Allow cluster administrators to set resource limits
#    and quotas per namespace, preventing one application from consuming
#    all cluster resources.
#
# 4. ORGANIZATION: Group related resources together, making it easier to
#    manage, monitor, and troubleshoot applications.
#
# 5. MULTI-TENANCY: Support multiple teams or applications on the same
#    cluster without interference.
#
# 6. NETWORK POLICIES: Enable network segmentation and security policies
#    at the namespace level.
#
# 7. CLEANUP: Simplify resource cleanup by deleting the entire namespace
#    instead of individual resources.
